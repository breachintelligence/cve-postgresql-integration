# Polarity CVE-PostgreSQL Integration

![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-green.svg)

Polarity's PostgreSQL integration allows automated lookups to a PostgreSQL database using a user defined query.  The integration only supports running a single query.  As a result, it is recommended to pick a single entity type using the "Manage Integration Data" option on the integrations page.

This integration uses the excellent [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres).  While this integration will work out of the box, it primarily intended to provide a well-defined template for constructing your own custom PostgreSQL based integrations.

> Please note that ths integration is designed to work with a single database user account.  As a result you should make sure the database connection options (host, port, name, user, and password) are locked (i.e., all users share the same settings)

## PostgreSQL Integration Options


#### Database Host

The hostname or IP of the server running the PostgreSQL database you wish to connect to.  Note that you will likely need to make modifications to your pg_hba.conf file to allow the connection to be made.

#### Database Port

The port your database is running on.  Defaults to 5432.

#### Database Name

The name of the database you are connecting to.

#### User

The user you want the integration to connect to your postgres database as.  We recommend creating a read-only user for this purpose.

#### Password

The database password for the provided user above.

## Installation Instructions

Installation instructions for integrations are provided on the [PolarityIO GitHub Page](https://polarityio.github.io/).
